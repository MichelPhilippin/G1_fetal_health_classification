## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and classification of fetal health status using cardiotocography (CTG) data. The goal is to apply Python-based data analysis and machine learning techniques to a real-world biomedical dataset in order to classify fetal health into clinically relevant categories.

The project is part of a bioinformatics programming course and is hosted in a central repository where students showcase their applied work.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset consists of features extracted from fetal cardiotocograms, which measure fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Each sample is labeled with a fetal health status.

### Target Classes
- `1` — Normal  
- `2` — Suspect  
- `3` — Pathological  

### Features
The dataset includes numerical features such as:
- Baseline fetal heart rate  
- Accelerations  
- Decelerations  
- Variability measures  
- Histogram-based statistics  

All features are derived from CTG signal analysis and are commonly used in obstetrics.

## Project Objectives
- Explore and understand biomedical data using Python  
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Apply machine learning models for classification  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics  
- Interpret results in a biological and clinical context
